A project to determine a method for assigning two colors of jerseys to each team in a sports league
that maximizes the minimum "contrast" achievable between any random pair of teams.

Colors are measured in degrees (0 - 359). Contrast between two colors x and y is equal to the lesser of
-- abs(x - y)
-- min(x,y) + 360 - max(x,y)

jersey-colors.py contains function definitions used to create sample leagues with color assignments, generate
matchups, and calculate contrasts.

jersey-colors.ipynb contains the walkthrough of using jersey-colors.py to benchmark the performance of different
assignment strategies.
